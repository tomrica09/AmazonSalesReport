### Data Description

Our analysis is based on a dataset encompassing several key aspects of Amazon's order and sales operations:

1. **Order Details**: This includes *Order ID*, *Order Date*, and *Order Item Quantity*. These fields help track the number of orders and items purchased per day and monitor trends in daily transaction volume.

2. **Sales Metrics**: The dataset includes financial information such as *Item Price* and *Revenue*. These metrics allow us to evaluate total and daily sales performance.

3. **Promotions**: The *promotion-ids* column indicates whether an order was made with a promotion. This enables us to assess the effectiveness of promotional campaigns in driving sales and customer engagement.

4. **Time Dimension**: Derived fields such as *purchase_month* and *purchase_day* were created to enable temporal analysis and comparisons across different months and days.

5. **Product Information**: Each record contains *Product ID* and *Product Category*, which could help identify trends in product popularity and category-based sales performance.

This structured data allows for comprehensive performance tracking and behavioral analysis, forming the foundation of our insights and recommendations.

### Executive Summary

Amazon India's sales analysis from March to June 2022 reveals a total revenue of ₹78.59 million and 128,975 orders, with an average order value (AOV) of ₹609.36. Sales peaked in April at ₹28.84 million before gradually declining through June. While May recorded the highest AOV at ₹623.85, promotional campaigns played a key role in order volume, driving nearly 62% of total orders and contributing ₹53.59 million in revenue, which is over 68% of total sales. However, promotion efficiency slightly declined month-over-month, indicating potential saturation or diminishing returns. These insights suggest that while promotions significantly boost performance, refining targeting strategies and optimizing non-promotional channels can enhance revenue sustainability and customer engagement moving forward.
